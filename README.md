# ohiovsthefield
Allows a user a simple choice. To live out the rest of their meaningless
existence in Ohio, or to play the field and hope for a winner in a evenly
distributed random selection of a different state. In either case a randomly
assigned congressional district is given, for which the user must live the
remainder of their lives. Travel within the state is allowed, but you may
never again leave your assigned state. Good Luck!
